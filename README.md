## Geneformer

Individual functions are copied from the [Geneformer](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06139-9) paper's original GitHub page. The two notebooks are elaborated evaluation of Geneformer on some endothelial cells available [here]([/guides/content/editing-an-existing-page#modifying-front-matter](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections/e5f58829-1a66-40b5-a624-9046778e74f5)). Start with te tokenizer notebook and then use eval notebook to apply Geneformer on the tokenized data. 

In these notebook, I haven't used geneformer as a package and have opened up the package to use basic "transformers" and "datasets" to make algorithm pipeline less abstract and closer to the standard routine used in Hugging face.
